"""
A NgrexPattern is a tgrep-type pattern for matching node configurations in one of the Networkx 
structures. Unlike tgrep but like Unix grep, there is no pre-indexing of the data to be searched. 
Rather there is a linear scan through the graph where matches are sought.

A node/edge is represented by a set of attributes and their values contained by curly braces: 
`{attr1:value1;attr2:value2;...}`. Therefore, {} represents any node/edge in the graph. 
Attributes must be plain strings; values can be regular expressions blocked off by "/". 
(I think regular expressions must match the whole attribute value; so that /NN/ matches "NN" only, 
while /NN.* / matches "NN", "NNS", "NNP", etc.)
